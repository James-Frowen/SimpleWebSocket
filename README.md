[![Build](https://github.com/James-Frowen/SimpleWebSocket/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/James-Frowen/SimpleWebSocket/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)


SimpleWebSocket adds websocket support to [Mirage](https://github.com/MirageNet/Mirage).


This uses [SimpleWebTransport](https://github.com/James-Frowen/SimpleWebTransport) and has a lot of room to be optimized.
